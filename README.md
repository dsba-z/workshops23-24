# DSBA Introduction to Programming // Workshops 23 and 24
Spring semester 2020/21


Enums, bitwise operations, tests.


## Task 1. Get bit at index. (Problem B from Contest 6) 

You are given an integer number **A** and an index **i**. Find and print the bit at position **i** in the number. The least significant bits have the lower indices. 


Example input: 
```
9 1
```
Example output: 
```
1
```
 

## Task 2. Number of ones. (Problem D from Contest 6) 

You are given an integer number **A** in the range 0 <= A <= 4*10^18. Print the number of bits set to 1 in the binary representation of *A*. 

Example input: 
```
9 
```
Example output: 
```
2 
```
 

Example input: 
```
126 
```
Example output: 
```
6 
```
 

## Task 3. Output Binary Number. (Not from Contest 6) 

Write a function that takes an unsigned integer number and prints its binary representation. Print all 32 bits, including leading zeros. Separate groups of 4 bits with apostrophes ('). 

Additional task: 
Implement a version of this function that works with signed integers. 

Example input: 
```
5 
```
Example output: 
```
0000'0000'0000'0000'0000'0000'0000'0101 
```
